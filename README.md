# Exploring Natas Levels – Individual Assignment

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my submission for the 2nd Year, 1st Semester Individual Assignment for the **SNP** module. The project focuses on exploring the **Natas** levels, a series of web security challenges designed to teach and test various aspects of web application security.

## 🔐 About Natas

**Natas** is a web-based wargame that challenges players to solve a series of progressively difficult security challenges. Each level requires the player to exploit vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass to obtain the password for the next level.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

Throughout the assignment, I employed various tools and techniques to solve the challenges, including:

* **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and modifying HTTP requests.
* **curl**: For making HTTP requests from the command line.
* **Python**: For scripting and automating certain tasks.
* **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting and manipulating web pages.

## 📄 Documentation

The `Natas.pdf` file provides detailed explanations and step-by-step solutions for each level, including:

* **Level 0 to Level 1**: Introduction to basic web vulnerabilities.
* **Level 2 to Level 3**: Exploring file inclusion and directory traversal.
* **Level 4 to Level 5**: Understanding cookies and session management.
* **Level 6 and beyond**: Advanced challenges involving encoding, encryption, and more.
